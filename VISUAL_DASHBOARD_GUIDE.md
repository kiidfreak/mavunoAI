## 🎯 Design Principles for Low-Literacy Users

### 2. **Colors = Meaning**
- 🟢 Green = Good, Approved, Healthy
- 🔵 Blue = Water, Rain, Information
- 🟡 Yellow = Warning, Medium
- 🔴 Red = Danger, Low (used sparingly)

### 3. **Numbers = Big & Bold**
- Credit Score: **82** (not 0.82)
- Loan Amount: **50,000 KSh** (with commas)
- Progress: **10/15** (fraction, not percentage)

### 4. **Visual Progress**
- Progress bars instead of percentages
- Filled circles instead of numbers
- Color gradients show health

### 5. **One Action Per Screen**
- Signin: Click your face → Dashboard opens
- Credit: See score → Click "Get Loan" button
- No multi-step forms
