## 🎤 **Demo & Pitch Script (10 Minutes Total)**

### **SLIDE 1 (30 seconds) - OPEN WITH EMOTION**
[You walk on stage, hold up a cheap Nokia phone]

"Show of hands—who here owns a smartphone?"

[Pause, most hands go up]

"Now keep your hand up if you think THIS phone can access NASA satellite data."

[Pause, hands go down, laughter]

"Wrong. THIS phone just saved a farmer's crop in Machakos this morning. Let me show you how."

[Click to Slide 2]

### **SLIDE 2-3 (1 minute) - ESTABLISH URGENCY**
"Kenya just survived the worst drought in 40 years. 2.4 million livestock dead. But here's the thing—NASA SAW IT COMING. SMAP soil moisture, CHIRPS rainfall, MODIS vegetation—all screaming 'DROUGHT!' months in advance.

But farmers didn't get that warning. Why? Because NASA data lives in APIs and dashboards they can't access.

Meet John. Nokia 105 phone. 2 acres of onions. Last season, he lost 40% of his crop—KES 200,000 gone—because he watered too late. NASA's SMAP satellite KNEW his soil was at 48% moisture. John just couldn't read that data.

98% of Kenyan farmers have mobile phones. Only 20% use agricultural apps. That's 4 MILLION farmers with phones in their pockets and satellites over their heads, but NO CONNECTION between them.

That's the gap we close."

[Click to Slide 4]

### **SLIDE 4 (1 minute) - SOLUTION DEMO**
"MavunoAI is that connection. Here's how it works:

*[Pull out your phone, dial 384#]*

Watch this. I'm dialing *384# right now—this is our USSD service. Works on ANY phone, no internet needed.

[Show screen as you navigate]

'Welcome to MavunoAI. 1. Onion Advice.'

I press 1.

'Should I irrigate? Press 1.'

I press 1.

[Read the response]

'Soil moisture: 58%. Status: LOW. Recommendation: Irrigate within 24 hours. NASA SMAP data updated 1 day ago.'

That's it. NASA satellite data → farmer decision → crop saved. No app download, no data costs, no university degree needed.

And for smartphone users? [Show WhatsApp] Same advice, but with charts, images, neighbor comparisons."

[Click to Slide 5]

### **SLIDE 5-6 (2 minutes) - MODULES DEEP DIVE**
"We focus on two modules where NASA data creates massive impact:

ONIONS: 30-40% of harvests lost annually. Why? Three reasons:

- Wrong irrigation timing → SMAP surface moisture (0-5cm) tells us EXACTLY when bulbs need water
- Aflatoxin contamination → MODIS temperature warns when fields exceed 25°C danger zone
- Disease outbreaks → CHIRPS rainfall + humidity predicts purple blotch risk

[Point to before/after images]

This farm: NDVI 0.42 without our system. NDVI 0.65 with it. That's the difference between 14 tons per hectare and 18 tons. That's KES 120,000 saved.

APIARY—and this is where we get unique:

[Click to Slide 6]

Nobody else will pitch beekeeping at this hackathon. But here's why judges should care:

Climate change is shifting flowering patterns. Beekeepers don't know where nectar will be. We use MODIS NDVI to predict flowering intensity 2-4 weeks ahead.

[Point to map]

See this? Beekeeper's current location: NDVI 0.42. But 30km away, MODIS shows 0.68—that's 50% more flowers! Move your hives, earn KES 8,800 extra honey revenue. Cost to move: KES 5,000. Net gain: KES 3,800.

This solves THREE problems: farmer income, pollinator conservation, and climate adaptation. All from one MODIS data feed."

### **SLIDE 7 (1.5 minutes) - GAME DEMO**
"But here's our secret weapon: we teach farmers through gaming first.

[Screen share or click to game]

This is FarmSim. You manage a virtual farm. Day 45, your soil moisture drops to 58%.

[Show decision dialog]

SMAP data says that's below optimal. Rain forecast: 15mm in 3 days, but only 65% confidence.

What do you do?

- Irrigate now (safe but costs 5,000 KES)
- Wait for rain (free but risky)
- Split the difference

[Click through]

You choose to wait. Rain comes late. Your onions stress. Harvest: 14 tons instead of 18.

[Show neighbor comparison]

Your neighbor irrigated based on SMAP data. Their NDVI stayed at 0.65. They got 18 tons.

Now you've LEARNED why that USSD alert saying 'Irrigate today' matters. Game teaches, USSD implements, farmers succeed.

Every scenario uses REAL NASA data from actual satellites. When farmers play this, they're not just gaming—they're training to use the most powerful agricultural intelligence system on Earth."

### **SLIDE 8 (1 minute) - CARBON ANGLE**
"But we're not just helping farmers grow crops. We're creating verifiable climate impact.

[Point to dashboard]

This farmer sequestered 5.2 tonnes of CO₂ this year. How do we know? Landsat proves it. NDVI time series shows land restoration. Soil health improved from 62% to 87%.

That becomes carbon credits. That becomes ESG reporting for companies. That becomes extra income for farmers.

We already have 60 Carbon Corp entities identified—banks, input suppliers, processors—who NEED this satellite-verified impact data for their ESG reporting.

Equity Bank wants to reduce loan risk using our NDVI crop health scores. Brookside Dairy wants pasture monitoring for 5,000 dairy farmers. These aren't hypothetical partnerships—we're in discussions NOW."

### **SLIDE 9 (45 seconds) - TRACTION**
"And this isn't vaporware. [Hold up phone again] 72 farmers are using this RIGHT NOW.

Dial *384#, it works. WhatsApp bot responds in Kikuyu or English. Dashboard shows real farms with real satellite data.

2,450 Mavuno Points earned through our gamification system. 87-91% sustainability scores, satellite-verified.

This is deployed. This is working. This is scaling."

### **SLIDE 10 (30 seconds) - CLOSE STRONG**
"Five million Kenyan farmers. Ninety-eight percent have mobile phones. But only twenty percent use agricultural technology.

That's not a market failure. That's a design challenge.

We solved it by respecting three things:

- The phones farmers already own (Nokia works as well as iPhone)
- The data NASA already collects (SMAP, MODIS, CHIRPS, Landsat)
- The networks farmers already trust (cooperatives, extension officers, M-Pesa)

Our vision: Make NASA's satellites as accessible to a farmer with a $15 Nokia as to a Silicon Valley company with supercomputers.

Every farmer deserves satellite intelligence.

Thank you. Questions?"

## 🎯 **Judge Q&A Prep (Anticipate These)**

**Q: "SMAP's 9km resolution is too coarse for individual farms."**
A: "Correct. We use it as a regional indicator, then downscale with higher-res CHIRPS rainfall (5.5km) and Landsat NDVI (30m) for field-level precision. Farmers don't need exact moisture percentages—they need 'irrigate now' vs 'wait for rain' decisions. SMAP provides that reliably."

**Q: "How do you handle illiterate farmers?"**
A: "Three ways: Voice narration in Swahili/Kikuyu for all instructions. Icon-heavy interface with minimal text. And critically, partnership with extension officers and cooperatives—trusted intermediaries who train farmers on the system."

**Q: "What's your path to sustainability after the hackathon?"**
A: "Three revenue streams already validated: Farmer premium subscriptions (KES 200/month—cheaper than 2 SMS bundles). Entity dashboards ($15-50K/year for ESG reporting). Government contracts for extension officer access. Year 1 target: $320K revenue. We're already talking to Equity Bank and Brookside Dairy."

**Q: "Why onions and bees instead of maize?"**
A: "Focus beats breadth. Onions have 40% loss rates—dramatic ROI story. Bees are UNIQUE—nobody else will pitch pollinators, yet they're critical for climate resilience. Both prove the modular platform works. Then we add maize, tomatoes, dairy—but we prove it with high-impact pilots first."
